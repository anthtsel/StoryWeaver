## Original User Request:
Description:
Let users step into a living, breathing story of their own design ‚Äî powered by AI. They‚Äôll begin by selecting a theme (like space, fantasy, or horror), and from there, the LLM takes over to build a choose-your-own-adventure experience that unfolds based on their decisions.

Each choice the user makes triggers a new piece of story from the LLM, evolving the plot in real time. It's like playing Dungeons & Dragons... if the dungeon master were an AI with unlimited imagination.

This app is super fun for solo play, nostalgic users, or casual gaming sessions ‚Äî and it‚Äôs perfect for all ages.
